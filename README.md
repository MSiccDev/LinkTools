# LinkTools

A small set of helper libraries to make it easier to deal with Links in .NET applications.


## Core
Provides code shared between all projects.

## LinkPreview
A small helper package to get preview data from urls. Not yet perfect, but already doing a decent job. Considered as work in progress.


## UrlCleaner

A small helper package to clean campaign and other tracking parameters.
